      COMPILING BPMDJ
  
If you want to compile this package you need to create a defines
file. The defines file is a file that contains a number of definitions of
program locations. Depending on the distribution a standard definition file
can be used:

  gentoo -> defines.gentoo
  debian -> defines.debian
  ... and others ...

If you are running another distribution please take a look at one of these
defines files and adapt where necessary. The file format is self explanatory !
After creating such a file be sure to send it to me
(werner.van.belle@vub.ac.be) so I can include it in the next release.

Some compile time flags:
 
  COMPILE_OSS 
    add to the CFLAGS '-D COMPILE_OSS' to include native support for OSS 
    drivers. Please note that these drivers might have a loosy latency reporting.

  COMPILE_ALSA 
    add to the CFLAGS '-D COMPILE_ALSA' to include native support for alsalib. 
    Don't forget to add -lasound to the LDFLAGS !

These defines files proably include distcc and ccache. These two programs are 
of course not striclt necesasry. Removing these words from the defines file 
should still work.

PS: I don't want to use automake configure like things because they are simply
too difficult to use. Makefiles become unreadable, configuring for KDE
requires more work and testing from the programmer than necessary and in fact,
I don't like it because the configure suit sounds more like a hack than a
well designed software deployment process.
