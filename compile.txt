      COMPILING BPMDJ
  
If you want to compile this package you need to create a defines
file. The defines file is a file that contains a number of definitions of
program locations. Depending on the distribution a standard definition file
can be used:

  gentoo -> defines.gentoo
  debian -> defines.debian
  ... and others ...

If you are running another distribution please take a look at one of these
defines files and adapt where necessary. The file format is self explanatory !
After creating such a file be sure to send it to me
(werner.van.belle@itek.norut.no) so I can include it in the next release.

Some compile time flags:
 
  COMPILE_OSS 
    add to the CFLAGS '-D COMPILE_OSS' to include native support for OSS 
    drivers. Please note that these drivers might have a loosy latency reporting.

  COMPILE_ALSA 
    add to the CFLAGS '-D COMPILE_ALSA' to include native support for alsalib. 
    Don't forget to add -lasound to the LDFLAGS !

These defines files probably include distcc and ccache. These two programs are 
of course not strictly necessary. Removing these words from the defines file 
should fix problems related to these.
