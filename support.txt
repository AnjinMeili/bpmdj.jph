Creating this program takes a lot of work. On one side there is the creative
process of inventing new algorithms and concepts, on the other side there is
the realization of these concepts into a program.

The past 4 years the software has been open sourced, free to use by anybody
under a GPL license. Recently I've become very frustrated about this. Open
source promises a lot of things. Among those things is the possibility to 
develop with many people on the same thing. In practice however, I've been 
contacted by many people which all 'wants' things, but very few people 
actually offer help and those who actually do are far from qualified to 
do so in a useable manner.

Aside from this, the development of the algorithms expressed in this program
are worth money, a lot of money. Also here I've been contacted by people
interested in whether the output of the algorithm can be used for free and
whether they can use the algorithm in their own software. Interestingly,
because they already have the software, I'm never in a position to negotiate
properly.

Other people contact me to see whether I want to help them out with their 
student project based on this software, others simply claim that they wrote it.
Bottomline here is that people seem to have absolutely no respect whatsoever
for the effort it took to create this software.

So then, what do I expect ?

I don't expect end users to pay for this stuff, however I insist that
- people are honest about their own possibilities and not claim things they 
  didn't do, 
- or sell things they didn't make, 
- or 'reinvent' things without giving proper credit (and back communication). 
The time _I_ spent to write this software and invent the algorithms seems 
easily forgotten when the dealine comes close.

Since I'm a researcher in heart, the software remains GPL, but please if you
are in the possiblity to support this work in any way, please do so. You can
