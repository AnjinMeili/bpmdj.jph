/**
 * @defgroup data Data
 *
 * The data layer was written in order to solve a number of annoyances when 
 * programming in C++
 * 
 * - C++ does not provide automatic serialization/deserialization and data 
 *   compatibility between different hosts and processes is a modern necessity
 *   when writing applications.
 * - There is no generic 'object' type in C++ and simply implementations (e.g:
 *   creating a library/application Object root) easily leads to inefficient 
 *   representations with generic types such as Integers, Floats,... are 
 *   subclassed from such a root. For instance: an array of native integers
 *   versus 'object' based integers might be twice as large.
 * - Many generic data formats lacks multidimensional arrays, requiring the
 *   user to wrap arrays within arrays, which in itself might make specific 
 *   optimizations impossible. Traversing through multi- dimensional operations
 *   can often be optimized by properly sorting the stride, sizes and offsets 
 *   before iteration. This can lead to efficient use of specialized operations
 *   for linear blocks of data. E.g MMX optimized array operations. By 
 *   providing an array data type this kind of use has become feasible.
 * - Often, when working with generic data types in C++, downcasting is a 
 *   necessity. However, downcasts themselves override compiler warnings and 
 *   bypassing the type checking. Since many errors occur due to wrong 
 *   downcasts, it is necessary to integrate a type checking operator into a 
 *   generic data framework.
 * - Memory allocation of generic data types is often overlooked, leading to 
 *   memory leaks or inefficient use of memory. In the data library memory 
 *   allocation is performed using reference counting, which leads to one of 
 *   the more efficient implementations as observed by [REF]. The requirement
 *   on the application program is not to introduce loops, but this is not a 
 *   problem, since those classes are aimed to provide an efficient 
 *   serialization/deserialization interface.
 * - Languages that provide generic data types often also include garbage 
 *   collection features. Those languages are often too impractical for heavy 
 *   duty operations such as image processing and sound processing. (however 
 *   their 'heaviness' is not necessarily linked to the garbage collection as
 *   such)
 * 
 * @todo We should replace the template array class with the generic message 
 * class which still resides in the hatchery. There is no need to use this 
 * complicated template since it does not make programs perform much faster.
 * Instead we seem to loose a lot of flexibility by using these templates.
