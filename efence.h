/*
 * Electric Fence - Red-Zone memory allocator.
 * Bruce Perens, 1988, 1993
 * 
 * This is a special version of malloc() and company for debugging software
 * that is suspected of overrunning or under-running the boundaries of a
 * malloc buffer, or touching free memory.
 *
 * It arranges for each malloc buffer to be followed (or preceded)
 * in the address space by an inaccessible virtual memory page,
 * and for free memory to be inaccessible. If software touches the
 * inaccessible page, it will get an immediate segmentation
 * fault. It is then trivial to uncover the offending code using a debugger.
 *
 * An advantage of this product over most malloc debuggers is that this one
 * detects reading out of bounds as well as writing, and this one stops on
 * the exact instruction that causes the error, rather than waiting until the
 * next boundary check.
 *
 * There is one product that debugs malloc buffer overruns
 * better than Electric Fence: "Purify" from Purify Systems, and that's only
 * a small part of what Purify does. I'm not affiliated with Purify, I just
 * respect a job well done.
 *
 * This version of malloc() should not be linked into production software,
 * since it tremendously increases the time and memory overhead of malloc().
 * Each malloc buffer will consume a minimum of two virtual memory pages,
 * this is 16 kilobytes on many systems. On some systems it will be necessary
 * to increase the amount of swap space in order to debug large programs that
 * perform lots of allocation, because of the per-buffer overhead.
