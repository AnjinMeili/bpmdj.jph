	  these two.
	+ added v1.10.0 for mpg123
4.1pl1:
        - modifications to the taglist could crash the selector
4.1:
	+ faster drawing of main songlist
	- if you had songs that were analyzed and marked as 'Empty' due to 
	  a wrong configuaration (file not accessible for instance) then 
          you might find that BpmDj will not reanalyze this song. You can 
	  fix this problem using the 'Clear Metadata' menuentry in the 
	  in the selection menu.
	- due to the upgrade to qt4 the order of the columns in the 
	  mainsonglist got lost you might need to move all your columns back 
	  in place.

          completely wrong and would put less weight on the first half
          of the song.
        - a bug in moc-qt4 from Qt 4.4.3 makes that the beatgraphlabel
          no longer compiled. We implemented a silly workaround
	+ mirroring and entire song database is done asynchronously
	- if the fragments were deleted while the selector was open, 
	  the program would crash
	- if the selector could not open the dsp device it would crash
	- Timer killed from wrong thread -> should be fixed now
	- removed some warnings about char* depcreatead conversions with 
	  the new gcc compiler
3.6:
	- fixed a compilation problem on debian platforms (moc-qt4 vc moc-qt3)
	- the dsp flag in the fragment_player will no longer lockup 
	  optimized compilations

	  place have now been 'removed'
	+ added 'use last cue' to the bpmmerger
	- removed a bug in song insertion in the queue
	- the playhistory would not remember a played song while the index 
	  was loading
	- the renamer scanner did not look for proper extensions
	- the automixer would sort songs in the wrong order; this has been fixed
	- .mpc files are recognized as well
3.5:
	- removed bpmmix, which was a nice idea but in the end not the goal 
	  of bpmdj
	- the history thisisplaying function had a small bug
	- the data reader will check the boundaries before addressing 
	  improper memory due to short files
        + added the location in the song information box
        - removed the similar scanner, since it didn't work that well
        + the statistics are calculated when calculate is pressed
        + removed the k letter from most binaries and programs
        + improved symbol/qstring singleton creation

	  the qlistviewitem lists 
        + loading while the ui is already useable
        - removed a segfault from the data-io writer constructor
        + removed unnecessary features such as player mixer / recorder and
	  kbpm-mix starter

	  entire program around the listview, which is getting quite

          color

          everything in memory, otherwise this issues an even better 
	  improvement)
