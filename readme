This program is a fully automatic BPM counter ! Given an MP3 file it will
automatically ind the tempo. The package contains a bpm-counter, a song-player
which uses this information to play a song at a different tempo and a file 
selector that offers the possibility to manage a large amount of mp3's.

Probably, you will need to compile the package yourself. To do so, read 
compile.txt. If you encounter any difficulties please contact me.

There is a complete manual 
online at http://bpmdj.sourceforge.net/
in the documentation directory 
in /usr/share/doc/bpmdj/

if you try to read this documentation in the debian documentation directory
make sure to unpack all appropriate files (gunzip *.gz)
