This program is a fully automatic BPM counter ! Given an MP3 file it will
automatically ind the tempo. The package contains a bpm-counter, a song-player
which uses this information to play a song at a different tempo and a file 
selector that offers the possibility to manage a large amount of mp3's.

Probably, you will need to compile the package yourself. To do so, read 
compile.txt. If you encounter any difficulties please contact me.

WHEN USING THE PROGRAM BE SURE THAT YOUR PATH INCLUDES THE CURRENT DIRECTORY,
OR DO A MAKE INSTALL !!!

There is a complete manual in the file
1) beatmixing.ps
2) online at http://bpmdj.sourceforge.net/
