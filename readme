This program is a fully automatic BPM counter. Given an MP3 file it will
automatically find the tempo. The package contains a bpm-counter, a song-player
which uses this information to play a song at a different tempo and a file 
selector that offers the possibility to manage a large amount of mp3's.

Probably, you will need to compile the package yourself. To do so, read 
compile.txt. If you encounter any difficulties please contact me.

There is a complete manual online at http://bpmdj.yellowcouch.org/
In case you don't have internet access, download the documentation package,
carry it with you home, and unzip it.

Suse pacakges are available at http://packman.links2linux.de/ 
and maintained by oc2pus@arcor.de
